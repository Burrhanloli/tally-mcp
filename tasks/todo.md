## Implementation Strategy

### 1. XML Request Pattern

All tools will follow the existing pattern:

```xml
<ENVELOPE>
    <HEADER>
        <TALLYREQUEST>Export Data</TALLYREQUEST>
    </HEADER>
    <BODY>
        <EXPORTDATA>
            <REQUESTDESC>
                <REPORTNAME>[ReportName]</REPORTNAME>
                <STATICVARIABLES>
                    <!-- Parameters -->
                </STATICVARIABLES>
            </REQUESTDESC>
        </EXPORTDATA>
    </BODY>
</ENVELOPE>
```

### 2. Error Handling

- Standardize error handling across all functions
- Add validation for required parameters
- Handle XML parsing failures gracefully

### 3. Response Formatting

- Create helper functions for common formatting tasks
- Ensure consistent output format across all tools
- Add proper null/empty data handling

### 4. Testing Approach

- Each tool will be implemented incrementally
- Test with sample data after each implementation
- Verify XML requests work with actual Tally instance

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for all parameters
- XML injection prevention
- No sensitive data logging
- Secure HTTP client configuration
